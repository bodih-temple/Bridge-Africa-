# Bridge-Africa-

A.I.M OR AFRICA IN MINIATURE is the first branch of this budding Bridge Africa GitHub project.
The goal of this A.I.M is simple: to host all the files for the pioneering e-commerce aka Cameroon Gallery.

CAMEROON GALLERY 2.0
Development Idea

1- Sculpt Maxine Moffet. Why?
Because our new 3D Web App will be so LIT that we would need an eloquent tour guide to kindly walk our visitors through the amazing Bridged Africa.

Work status: Working in progress (on Blender and Three.JS)
